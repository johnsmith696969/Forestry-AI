    "description": "The Hammerhead GS-44 Grapple Saw is designed to pick up one log or multiple logs at a time and cut them from the safety of the operator cab.  Ideal for storm cleanup, sawmill yard, land clearing, logging, clearing hiking or biking or snowmobile trails, or for cutting logs to use in an outdoor wood boiler.  You simply grasp the log in the grapple and push a button to activate the hydraulic saw.  In addition to starting the saw, each time you press the saw button, it provides a squirt of oil to the saw bar from a dedicated bar oil tank built into the grapple saw.  This unit also works great for bucking up logs that are too big to fit in a firewood processor.  We offer this grapple saw in two versions, the standard version which has a 24\" diameter cut capacity and the XL which has a 30\" diameter max cut capacity.   Standard models come with the saw mounted on the right side of the grapple, or we offer an optional left mounted saws for use on excavators, telehandlers, and single boom skid steers from manufacturers like Volvo & JCB.  We also offer hydraulic saw motor options from Hydro Gear, Parker, & Sunfab.  The GS-44 Grapple Saw makes extensive use of high strength steel and incorporates industrial grade components to ensure excellent availability and a long service life._x000D_\nFor more information visit the Hammerhead Attachments website @ https://www.hammerheadattachments.com/rigid-grapple-saw.html",

With its standard 25 HP Kohler EFI or Optional Diesel upgrade, the 14-24 is capable of producing from 1 to 2 full cords of firewood per hour. The 14-24 will process up to 18\" diameter logs. This machine comes standard with a 2-strand live deck that can convert into a log lift. The integrated 10' hydraulic operated chain conveyor allows you to easily load firewood into a trailer or truck box. Hydraulic lever type controls operate the hydraulic saw, clamp, conveyor, and log lift. All 14-24's come standard with a hydraulically operated 4-way wedge, automatic bar oiler, last log measuring grid, and integrated taillights. Our one of a kind round log trough is built to better handle crooked logs at ease. A perfect machine for the homeowner who cuts firewood to heat his home or has a small firewood business. While the 14-24 is the smallest machine in the Brute Force line of processors, it is designed & built to the same standards as our larger machines. All Brute Force firewood processors are built to withstand the rigors of daily firewood production.\n\n https://youtu.be/zr49fg9j5iQ",

As the amps on the hammer mill climb the feed auger slows, when the amps reach a pre-set limit the feed conveyor stops to allow the hammer mill to catch up. This is all 3 phase 240v components. The hammer mill has a 1/4\" screen, which is the correct size for the pellet system.  It has a 40 HP motor. There is a small 220v blower which takes the feed stock out of the chamber, the hammer mill fills and feeds it into the hopper above the pellet mill.

The 16-24 is capable of producing from 2 to 3.5 cords per hour and will process up to 18\" diameter logs.\n\n The 16-24 comes standard with a 3-strand live deck that converts into a log lift and is easily hydraulically lowered and raised. The integrated 12' hydraulic operated chain conveyor allows you to easily load firewood into a trailer or truck box. The hydraulic saw, clamp, live deck, and log in-feed conveyor are all joystick controls for easy use. The 16-24 comes standard with a hydraulically operated 4-way wedge, Auto bar oiler and hydraulic oil cooler. Also standard is the last log measuring grid, integrated taillights, and round log trough for better handling of crooked logs.
